## No Requirements Changes

This change is a code organization improvement with no functional impact:

- No new requirements added
- No existing requirements modified
- No requirements removed

The behavior of error accumulation remains identical (messages separated by `"; "`); only the code structure changes through extraction into a shared utility type.
